# features

This folder contains feature-specific React components for your application. Each feature is typically a self-contained module representing a business domain or user-facing functionality.

## Example

```
/feature/
  UserProfile.tsx   // User profile feature component
  Dashboard.tsx     // Dashboard feature component
```
